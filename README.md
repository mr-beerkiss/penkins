# penkins
Photobox Hackathon 2016

The goal of Penkins is to control the output an Ada Fruit RGB Matrix via a Raspberry PI.  

The output will initially be based around Jenkins builds.  

We require:

-  Code to send display data to the RGB Matrix (Python/C)
-  Code to hook into Jenkins and relay the events to the subsystem powering the Matrix (Node, of course :p)

See [this link](https://drive.google.com/a/photobox.com/file/d/0B7geq-WIbw-2alJNMUtPdVRTZzQ/view?usp=sharing) for an example Storyboard of how this might look.
